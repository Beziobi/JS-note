
--> Conditional Statements

Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.
You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.
In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

*Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
*Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
*Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
*Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

-> The if Statement
Use the if statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition 
is true.

** Syntax
if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}

-> The else Statement
Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.

** Syntax
if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}

-> The else if Statement
Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

** Syntax
if (condition1) {
  //  block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}
